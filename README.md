### üîç Project Summary

This project features a fully interactive **Executive Dashboard** built using Microsoft Power BI.

### üìà Visual Insights

#### 1. **Sales Trend Over Time**
- A combo chart compares **yearly sales performance** and **revenue growth (%)**.
- The bar graph represents units or total revenue by month/year, while the line graph overlays revenue growth.
- It helps identify sales cycles, seasonal trends, and periods of decline or growth.

#### 2. **Planned vs. Actual Sales by Category**
- A horizontal bar chart compares **actual sales** against **planned sales** for different product categories.
- The goal here is to measure **performance against targets**, with a visual gap to highlight underperforming or outperforming categories.
- Annotations show absolute dollar differences and a small callout indicates the **advance-on-plan percentage** (5.26%).

#### 3. **Units Sold by Segment**
- A bubble chart displays units sold across customer segments like "All Season," "Economy," "Youth," etc.
- The size and position of each bubble reflect both the number of units and comparative performance.
- Helps in customer segmentation analysis to target profitable or underperforming groups.

#### 4. **Regional Sales Distribution**
- A donut chart showcases **sales distribution by region** (e.g., West, East, Central).
- Visually demonstrates which regions are contributing most to revenue.
- Aids in regional performance tracking and strategy formulation.

#### 5. **Sales Performance by State**
- A filled map (choropleth) of the United States indicates sales volume by state using color gradients.
- Darker shades represent higher sales performance.
- Useful for **geographic sales analysis** and territory planning.
